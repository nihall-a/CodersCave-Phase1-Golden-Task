                        An overflowing inbox is a productivity killer. But Gemini can help. Instead of squinting through every single message, simply fire off a quick “Summarise the last email from [sender],” and Gemini will give you the shorter version.

                    <p>Popularised by CrossFit coach Chris Hinshaw, this test involves standing on one foot with bare feet. Then, without letting the foot that is in the air touch the ground, and maintaining complete control and balance, try picking up your sock from the floor and putting it on.  After this, bend again to pick up your shoe, wear it, and tie your laces while keeping your balance intact. Once done, do the same on the other side without falling or kneeling to pass the test. </p>

That game when the power transfers from the hands of Manchester City to Arsenal, or that match City reimposes itself, or that contest Liverpool sneaks past their rivals to the title march. There is a thrilling intrigue that the league has not sustained for more than a decade.</p>

                    <p>
                        All India Football Federation (AIFF) president Kalyan Chaubey on Friday constituted a 5-member panel which will hold discussions with national coach Igor Stimac and seek clarification on his recent comments where he said he would quit his position if India failed to reach the third round of the World Cup qualifiers.

“Never mind the contract, If I don’t take India to the third round, I will leave,” Stimac had said at the pre-match press conference in Guwahati on Monday. “With my pride, with my honour, with everything that I have done in the last five years. But if we qualify, there’s plenty of work that has to be done.”
